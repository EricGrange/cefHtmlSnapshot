# cefHtmlSnapshot

Command-line utility for Windows whose aim is to take snapshots of HTML pages and save them as images or PDF

This project requires CEF4Dephi  https://github.com/salvadordf/CEF4Delphi/ by Salvador DÃ­az Fau
and leverages the Chromium Embedded Framework (https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/)

Project is still experimental and not functional yet.

It started as hack of the "ConsoleBrowser2" demo of CEF4Delphi, additional bugs are mine.
